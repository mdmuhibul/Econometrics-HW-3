From my point of view, My hypothesis is that people got vaccinated more who have children comparable to who don't have children. In addition, people who have children also went to restaurants less.
I split the tables into KIDS_LT5Y, KIDS_5_11Y, KIDS_12_17Y, and people who don't have children to compare the proportion.

 77.7 % of people who have children under 5 got the vaccine. 
 79.2 % of people who have children 5 - 11 years old got the vaccine. 
 80.2 % of people who have children 12 - 17 years old got the vaccine. 
 90.1 % of people who don't have children got the vaccine.
 
 #To conclude, young children are not interested to motivate people for vaccination. Age is one of the key factor. 
 
 #Children under 5 in HH and vaccine status
